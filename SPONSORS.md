# Supporting the OpenLogReplicator Infrastructure

## Mission

Parsing Oracle Redo Logs is a mission‑critical task that requires a specialized hardware lab to simulate RAC, ASM, and Data Guard environments.
OpenLogReplicator treats reliability as a service, and that reliability is only possible with continuous, private validation at scale.

## What Sponsorship Funds

- High‑performance servers for continuous regression testing.
- Enterprise‑grade storage for redo log throughput benchmarks.
- Maintenance and expansion of the 1,000+ private test case suite.

## Sponsorship Tiers

- **Infrastructure Supporter** (Individual).
- **Corporate Partner** (Logo in README, priority in roadmap).
- **Enterprise Stability Partner** (Direct configuration validation against the private test suite).
