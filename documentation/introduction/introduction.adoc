This document introduces OpenLogReplicator and explains its role in change data capture (CDC).
No prior knowledge is required.

== Big picture

Databases evolve continuously: rows are inserted, updated, and deleted by many users and processes.
Tracking these changes reliably is essential for replication, analytics, auditing, and downstream integrations.
OpenLogReplicator captures those changes from the database redo logs and publishes them to message systems so downstream consumers can process them in near real time.

== Change data capture

Change Data Capture (CDC) is the process of detecting and recording data changes so they can be propagated to other systems.
CDC enables use cases such as replication, caching updates, audit trails, and feeding event-driven architectures without modifying application logic or requiring bulk extracts.

== CDC elements

A typical CDC pipeline contains:

1. Change capture: read and record changes from the source system in a processable format.
2. Storage and transformation: persist captured events and apply optional filtering, mapping, or format conversion.
3. Delivery: transmit events to downstream systems (message brokers, streaming platforms, or other sinks).
4. Monitoring and management: observe progress, handle failures, and manage configuration and checkpoints.

== The source database

Oracle Database is a widely used commercial relational database.
It stores transactional data and maintains consistency for concurrent workloads.
According to {url-db-engines}[DB-Engines], Oracle Database ranks among the most popular database systems.

== OpenLogReplicator

OpenLogReplicator is a GPL‑licensed, open-source change-capture component developed by {author} and hosted on {url-github}[GitHub].
It reads Oracle redo log files directly (binary read) and emits change events to message systems such as Kafka.
Key characteristics:

* Reads redo logs without relying on Oracle LogMiner.
* Designed for minimal impact on the source database and can operate without a continuous database connection.
* Focused on change capture and event emission; downstream storage, transformation and consumption are handled by other components.
* Extensible - additional sinks beyond Kafka can be implemented.

[TIP]
====
OpenLogReplicator provides the capture and emission stage of a CDC pipeline.
It does not implement long-term storage, complex transformations, or end-to-end delivery orchestration — those responsibilities belong to downstream components.
