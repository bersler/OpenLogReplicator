Messages below indicate errors that occur at runtime.
Each message includes an error code to simplify lookup and troubleshooting.

==== code 10001: "file: <file name> - open for read returned: <message>"

The file is missing or cannot be opened for reading.
Check that the file exists and permissions are correct.
Inspect OS logs and verify filesystem integrity.

==== code 10002: "file: <file name> - lock operation returned: <message>"

Failed to obtain an exclusive lock on the file.
Another process may be using the file (for example, another OpenLogReplicator instance).
Use `lsof` or platform tools to find open handles.

[TIP]
====
You can list file handles using operating system `lsof` command.
Refer to operating system documentation for locking files.
====

==== code 10003: "file: <file name> - get metadata returned: <message>"
