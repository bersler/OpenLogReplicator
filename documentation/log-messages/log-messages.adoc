This document describes messages of OpenLogReplicator which are written to the log.

== Introduction

The following message levels are used:

1. *Errors* -- Some functionality is not available, user should review the message and take appropriate action.
In some cases, the program may abort.
Messages can be suppressed by setting the `trace` parameter to `0`.

2. *Warnings* -- Something is not correct but may be intentional or not critical.
Messages can be suppressed by setting the `trace` parameter to `1`.

3. *Information* -- Program status.
Messages can be suppressed by setting the `trace` parameter to `2`.

4. *Debug* -- Debugging information.
Messages can be suppressed by setting the `trace` parameter to `3`.

5. *Trace* -- Detailed information about program internals.
Messages are controlled by the `trace` parameter.
Parameter `log-level` is not relevant for tracing.

IMPORTANT: By default, all error, warning and info messages are printed -- `trace` parameter is set to value `3`.

TIP: The documentation doesn't discuss _Trace_ messages in detail.
Those messages aren't intended to be used by users.
Format can change without notice.

== Warnings Messages

=== Warnings (6xxxx)

==== code 60001: "incomplete row for table (obj: <number>), probably IOT, xid: <xid>, offset: <number>"

This warning is most probably related to using schemaless mode with IOT tables.
In this case, please try to use schema mode instead.
If the problem persists, please report this issue.

==== code 60002: "unknown value (column: <column>): <number> - <data>)"

Might be related to extensive using of dbms_lob package.
In this case, please try to use direct DML operations for LOB columns instead.
If the problem persists, please report this issue.

==== code 60003: "incorrect LOB for xid: <xid>, data: <data>, location: <number>"

See comment for warning 60002.

==== code 60004: "can't find page <number> for xid: <xid>, LOB: <lob>, obj: <number>"

==== code 60008: "can't decode character: (x, y, z) using character set <name>, xid: <xid>"

The character field contained a character code which is invalid and can't be decoded.
If the field is not character, and the data is expected to be correct, please report this issue.

==== code 60009: "duplicate orphaned lob: <lob>, page: <number>"

See comment for warning 60002.

==== code 60010: "no match found for transaction rollback, skipping, SLT: <number>, USN: <number>"

This warning could appear during replication startup.
It means that the beginning of the transaction appeared probably before replication startup.

==== code 60011: "skipping transaction with no beginning: <details>"

Received commit for a transaction which started before replication startup.
The transaction is discarded.

==== code 60012: "aborting log dump"

The log dump is aborted because there was a problem with creating a file for the dump.

==== code 60013: "forced to continue working in spite of error"

In spite of redo log data error, the redo log is processed.
A message has been printed with the error which appeared during parsing.
Investigate the error anyway and verify if the data is correct.

==== code 60014: "verify redo log file for OP:10.8, len: <number>, data = [<number>, <number>, <number>, <number>]"

See comment for warning 60002.

==== code 60015: "big transaction divided (forced commit after <number> bytes), xid: <xid>"

A huge transaction has exceeded provided maximum size for transactions.

==== code 60016: "LOB is null for (obj: <number>, dataobj: <number>), offset: <number>, xid: <xid>"

See comment for warning 60002.

==== code 60017: "minimal supplemental log missing or redo log inconsistency for transaction <xid>, offset: <number>"

Verify if supplemental logging is enabled for the database.
If it is, and even after log switch the warning appears, please report this issue.

==== code 60018: "file: <file name> - couldn't write checkpoint"

Checkpoint file couldn't be created because of errors.
Verify the reason and try to fix it.

==== code 60019: "file: <file name> - load checkpoint failed, reference SCN missing"

Schema missing in checkpoint file.
Verify if the file is correct.
If the problem persists, please report this issue.

==== code 60020: "file: <file name> - load adaptive schema failed"

Adaptive schema load failed.
The program will continue without any schema.
Verify if the file is correct.
If the problem persists, please report this issue.

==== code 60021: "missing LOB index for LOB (OBJ#: <number>, DATAOBJ#: <number>, COL#: <number>)"

See comment for warning 60002.

==== code 60022: "missing TS#: <number>, BLOCKSIZE: <number>"

Missing information about tablespace in the database schema.
Verify if the tablespace is correct.
If the problem persists, please report this issue.

==== code 60023: "file: <file name> - position: <number> - unexpected end of file"

Unexpected end of a redo log file.
Verify if the file is correct.
If the problem persists, please report this issue.

==== code 60024: "file: <file name> - invalid header sequence (<number>, expected: <number>)"

Invalid information about a redo log sequence in the header.
Verify if the file is correct.
If the problem persists, please report this issue.

==== code 60025: "file: <file name> - block: <number> - invalid header checksum, expected: <number>, calculated: <number>"

Invalid checksum in the redo log header.
Verify if the file is correct.
If the problem persists, please report this issue.

==== code 60026: "stripping trailing '/' from <name> parameter; new value: <value>"

Stripped trailing '/' from the parameter value from the path parameter.

==== code 60027: "couldn't find archive log for seq: <number>, found: <number>, sleeping <number> us"

Missing an archive log file.
Verify if the file is correct.
If the problem persists, please report this issue.

==== code 60028: "can't get sequence from file: <file name> log_archive_format: <string> at position <number> format position <number>, <problem>"

Invalid archive log file name.
Verify if the file is correct.
If the problem persists, please report this issue.

==== code 60029: "message size (<number>) will exceed 'max-file-size' size (<number>)"

The defined maximum size for the file is too small to write a single message.
Increase the size.

==== code 60030: "rotation size is set too low (<number>), increase it, should rotate but too early (<file name>)"

The parameter for rotation size is too small.
Increase the number.

==== code 60031: "queue, full, sleeping <number> >ms, then retrying"

The queue for redo log data is full.
The program will sleep for a while and then retry.
Investigate the reason why the receiver is not able to process the data fast enough.

==== code 60032: "unknown request code: <message>"

Invalid request code received by the network client.

==== code 60033: "request decoder[<number>]: <data>"

Invalid request data received by the network client.

==== code 60034, "observed UPDATE operation for NOT NULL column with NULL value for table <owner>.<table> column <column>"

There could be cases that due to some upgrades from old versions or other unknown reasons, the BEFORE image for UPDATE command contains NULL value for a column that has been defied as NOT NULL.

By default, OpenLogReplicator would just print the informational message (but just once per column) and continue with the replication.

It is also possible to treat the AFTER image as the correct value and copy it to the BEFORE image of the column value.
This feature is experimental.
To achieve this behavior, the xref:../reference-manual/reference-manual.adoc#flags[flags] parameter should be set appropriately.

==== code 60035, "unknown database requested, got: <name>, expected: <name>"

The client requested a database which is not configured in the program.

==== code 60036, "incorrect XML data: <message>"

Data for XMLTYPE column type is not correct.

==== code 60037, "incorrect DDL data, offset: <number>"

Data for XMLTYPE column type is not correct.
