This section describes the JSON configuration file used by OpenLogReplicator.
The configuration is a single JSON object that contains top-level elements such as `source`, `target` and global options.
Files matching the documented schema ensure predictable behavior across upgrades.

.JSON config file main elements

The file is in JSON format.
The file should contain a single object with the following parameters:

[width="100%",cols="a,a,50%a",options="header"]
.Global parameters
|===

|Parameter
|Specification
|Notes

|`source`
|_list_ of xref:./source.adoc#source[source] elements, mandatory
|The list should contain just one source element.

|`target`
|_list_ of xref:./target.adoc#target[target] elements, mandatory
|The list should contain just one target element.

|`version`
|_string_, max length: 256, mandatory
|The value must be equal to `"1.1.0"`.

_TIP_: This is a safe-checker to make sure to check the content of the JSON configuration file during program upgrade.
During upgrade, always check the documentation for parameter changes and verify that the JSON configuration file is correct.

|`dump-path`
|_string_, max length: 256, default: `"."`
|The location where the `logdump` files are created.
The path can be relative to the current directory.

_NOTE_: This parameter is only valid when `dump-redo-log` parameter is set to non-zero value.

|`dump-raw-data`
|_number_, min: 0, max: 1, default: 0
|Print hex dump of vector data for all dumped OP codes.

Possible values are:

* `0` -– No hex dump is added to `DUMP-<nnn>.trace` file.

* `1` -– Before logdump information for every vector, the full vector is dumped in HEX format – useful for analysis of the content.

_NOTE:_ This parameter is only valid when `dump-redo-log` parameter is set to non-zero value.

|`dump-redo-log`
|_number_, min: 0, max: 2, default: 0
|Create output similar to `logdump` command which can be compared as string to verify if certain parameters have been correctly decoded.

Possible values are:

* `0` -- No `logdump file is created.

* `1` -- For every processed redo log file, a file `<database>-<nnn>.logdump` is created (`<database>` -– database name, `<nnn>` -- redo log sequence).

* `2` -- like `1` but additional information is printed which is not originally printed in `logdump` output -- for example details about supplemental log groups.

_CAUTION:_ The result doesn't have to fully match the results of `logdump`.There can be some inconsistency.
Not all redo OP codes are parsed and analyzed, and there is no guarantee that the results should be exactly the same.

|`log-level`
|_number_, min: 0, max: 4, default: 2
|Messages verbose level.

All messages are sent to _stderr_ output stream.

Possible values are:

* `0` -- _Silent_ -- don't print anything.

* `1` -- _Error_ -- print only error messages.

* `2` -- _Warning_ -- print error and warning messages (default setting).

* `3` -- _Info_ -- print error, warning and info messages.

* `4` -- _Debug_ -- print all messages.

|`trace`
|_number_, min: 0, max: 524287, default: 0
|Print debug information.

The value is a sum of various trace parameters, please refer to source code for details.

_CAUTION:_ The codes can change without prior notice.
