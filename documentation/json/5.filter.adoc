This section documents the `filter` element of the OpenLogReplicator JSON configuration.
It explains how to select which tables and transactions are tracked, how keys and tags are formed, and useful debugging options.

|Parameter
|Type / constraints
|Description and notes

|`table`
|_list_ of xref:./6.table.adoc#table[table] elements
|List of table selection rules (regular expressions or simple patterns) that determine which tables are tracked and emitted to targets.
A table matching any rule is tracked; rules may overlap.
Each entry may include optional fields such as `key`, `condition` and `tag`.

_NOTE:_ Rules apply to the fully qualified table name (usually `owner.table`).
Use `.` or `.*` style wildcards according to your pattern syntax.

|`separator` [[separator]]
|_string_, max length: 128, default: `","`
|Delimiter used to join multi-column key values when `key` fields are specified (see xref:./6.table.adoc#key[key] and xref:./6.table.adoc#tag[tag]).

_IMPORTANT:_ Choose a separator that cannot appear in key column values or ensure keys are escaped by the consumer.
Avoid a single common character (e.g., `,`) when key columns may contain that character.

|`skip-xid`
|_list_ of _string_ elements, max length: 32
|Transaction IDs to skip entirely (not emitted).
Acceptable XID forms include: `UUUUSSSSQQQQQQQQ`, `UUUU.SSS.QQQQQQQQ`, and `0xUUUU.SSS.QQQQQQQQ`.

_TIP:_ Use `skip-xid` for known maintenance transactions that should not be delivered to consumers.

|`dump-xid`
|_list_ of _string_ elements, max length: 32
|Debugging list: when an XID matches, internal diagnostics for that transaction are written to _stderr_ (useful for tracing processing of specific transactions).
_Same format_ as `skip-xid`.

|===

[NOTE]
====
- Use `separator` to concatenate multi-column keys when a `key` is provided.
Prefer rare character sequences (for example `|#|`) to avoid splitting ambiguity.
- Ensure any `key` or `tag` formatting rules match the expectations of downstream consumers; consider explicit escaping if consumers cannot handle separators inside key values.
