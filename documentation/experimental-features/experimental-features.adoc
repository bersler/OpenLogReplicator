This document describes experimental features available in OpenLogReplicator.
Experimental features are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled in the configuration file.

== Binary XMLType Support[[binary-xmltype]]

=== Configuration

Enable Binary XMLType support by setting the following flag in the configuration:

`"flags": 65536`

=== Overview

The database offers a binary format to store XMLType field using native compression.

Example schema definitions:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE USR1.ADAM1 (
  A NUMBER(3),
  B XMLTYPE
);

CREATE TABLE USR1.ADAM2 (
  A NUMBER,
  B XMLTYPE
) XMLTYPE B STORE AS CLOB;
----

In this example `USR1.ADAM1` uses the database's binary XMLType storage, while `USR1.ADAM2` stores the XMLType as a CLOB.

- Binary XMLType: efficient, optimized storage; requires decoding tools.
- CLOB XMLType: human-readable and stored as-in (preserves whitespace and formatting), but less space-efficient.

[NOTE]
====
When an XMLType is stored as a CLOB, the exact byte sequence inserted is preserved.
Binary storage performs internal optimizations and may change formatting and whitespace.
====

=== Decoding and Dictionaries

OpenLogReplicator decodes binary XMLType data using schema and dictionary information from the database's `XDB` schema.
Decoding can cause the `XDB` dictionaries to grow, which may affect performance and disk usage.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This feature is experimental.
It may not handle all cases correctly and could impact performance due to dictionary growth.
Report issues on the project's GitHub issues page to help improve reliability.
====

=== Limitations

Binary XMLType decoding is supported for all officially supported database versions except Oracle Database 23c.
Use with caution in production environments.

== Protocol Buffer output[[protobuf-output]]

Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a compact binary serialization format developed by Google.

This format is partially implemented in OpenLogReplicator as an experimental feature.
Some aspects of the Protobuf output are not yet finalized and may change in future releases.
This feature is under active development.
