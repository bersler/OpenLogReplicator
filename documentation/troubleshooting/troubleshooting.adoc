This document is a guide for troubleshooting the most common problems with the OpenLogReplicator.

== Configuration topics

=== Show checkpoint messages

Checkpoint messages indicate that the replication is working correctly.
Every message contains the SCN number and timestamp.
It confirms that a certain LWN block has been processed.
To reduce the number of messages, a checkpoint message is not sent for every LWN.

By default, the Checkpoint messages are disabled.
However, they are a good indicator for checking if the replication is working correctly.
They also can be treated as heartbeat messages.

If you want to include checkpoint messages to the target, set the `flags` parameter to `0x1000` in the configuration file.

== Runtime errors

If running OpenLogReplicator gives you a result like:

[source,shell]
----
#> ./OpenLogReplicator
./OpenLogReplicator: error while loading shared libraries: libclntshcore.so.19.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
----

This means that the libraries are not correctly linked.
Check which libraries are missing, example:

[source,shell]
----
#> ldd OpenLogReplicator
linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff75ddd000)
libasan.so.0 => /lib64/libasan.so.0 (0x00007f45c27df000)
libclntshcore.so.19.1 => not found
libnnz19.so => not found
libclntsh.so.19.1 => not found
librdkafka++.so.1 => not found
	librdkafka.so.1 => not found
	libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f45c25c3000)
	libstdc++.so.6 => /lib64/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007f45c22bc000)
libm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f45c1fba000)
libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f45c1da4000)
libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f45c19d6000)
libdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f45c17d2000)
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f45c576f000)
----

In the above example, all libraries marked with "not found" are missing.
Check that the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes paths where the required files are located.
If necessary – create appropriate symlinks.

== Performance issues

=== CPU saturation

Most possible bottlenecks are:

1. Disk read speed -- the reader thread reads all data sequentially using buffering.
If the stream of redo log files is greater than the speed of sequential read from disk -- delay might appear.

2. Transaction parsing -- redo log parsing is done using single thread.
If the volume of generated redo log files is higher than the speed of parsing -- delay might appear.

3. Output performance -- the writer thread sends the transactions to output (sink) using the provided connector.
If the target is accepting transactions slower than they are created -- delay might appear.
